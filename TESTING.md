## User Story Testing

### EPIC | Viewing and Navigation
*As a Site User, I can intuitively navigate around the site so that I can find content.*

- A navigation bar is visible on every page of the site which is fully responsive on different screen sizes.

![header](/media/image-32.png)

*As a Site User, I want to browse a list of available products so that I can choose one to explore further.*

*As a shopper, I want to view products by category so that I can easily browse items that match my interests.*

- By clicking the 'LEGOS OR OTHER TOYS' link in the navigation bar, a dropdown menu displays all available categories. Selecting a category redirects the user to a dedicated products page showcasing items from that specific category, with the category name clearly displayed as the page heading.

*As a shopper I can search all products so that I can find what I am looking for*

*As a shopper, I can sort all products so that I can view products based on price or title.*

- A sort box is located on the products page where users can sort all products by price,age in ascending or descending order and by title (A-Z).

  - While placing a new order, users can check a box under the delivery information to save the details they've just entered for future use.  

![Delivery Details](/media/delivery_info.png)

### EPIC | Purchasing
*As a shopper, I can add a number of products in different quantities to my shopping bag so that I can purchase them all together when I am ready.*

- Within the product detail page there is a quantity selector and an Add to Bag button. Shoppers can adjust the quantity by using the buttons located on either side of the input, or by typing in the amount.
- When the user clicks on the add to bag button, the chosen quantity of the product is added to the user's shopping bag.

![Product Detail](/media/product_me.png)

*As a shopper I can view a running total of my shopping bag as I am shopping so that I can see how much it costs in total.*

- As the user adds products to their bag, a toast message appears in the top right-hand corner of the screen informing the user that the item has been added, giving them a snapshot of the bag contents and the total cost of the bag.

![bag total](/media/bag.png)

*As a shopper I can view the contents of my shopping bag at any time so I can see what is included and the total cost.*

-  When the user completes the checkout form and presses submit their order should be completed.

*As a shopper, I can view an order confirmation after checkout so that I know my purchase was successful.*
- When the user submits the checkout form, they are redirected to a Checkout Success page where they can see an order confirmation and a summary of their order.

![order_confirmation](/media/delivery_details.png)
